# Terraform Security Baseline (Example)

This folder contains a minimal Terraform configuration that illustrates:

- S3 bucket for log or security-related storage
- Server-side encryption enabled by default
- Versioning enabled
- Public access blocked

The goal is not to provide a full production module, but to show how
security-related settings can be embedded directly into IaC.
